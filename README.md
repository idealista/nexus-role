## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the role for your ansible playbook. Once launched, it will install a [Nexus Repository Manager 3](https://help.sonatype.com/repomanager3) server in a Debian system.

### Prerequisities

Ansible 5.0.1 version installed.
Inventory destination should be a Debian environment.

Java must be installed to run the service. Check [Sonatype help](https://help.sonatype.com/repomanager3/installation/java-runtime-environment) to see supported versions. Java can be installed using the [Idealista's Java Ansible role](https://github.com/idealista/java-role).

For testing purposes, [Molecule](https://molecule.readthedocs.io/) with [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) as driver.

### Installing

Create or add to your roles dependency file (e.g requirements.yml) from GitHub:

```yml
- src: http://github.com/idealista/nexus-role.git
  scm: git
  version: 2.3.1
  name: nexus
```

or using [Ansible Galaxy](https://galaxy.ansible.com/idealista/nexus-role/) as origin if you prefer:

```yml
- src: idealista.nexus-role
  version: 2.3.1
  name: nexus
```

Install the role with ansible-galaxy command:

```sh
ansible-galaxy install -p roles -r requirements.yml -f
```

#### Example playbook:

```yml
---
- hosts: someserver
  roles:
    - nexus
```

## Usage

Look to the [defaults](defaults/main.yml) properties file to see the possible configuration properties.

Check in the maven section how can you set up a oracle maven repository.

You can edit nexus config and dashboards via template or webui.

## Testing

molecule test --platform=Debian9
```
